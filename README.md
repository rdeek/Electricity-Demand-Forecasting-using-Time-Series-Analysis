# Electricity Demand Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## Introduction

Today, electricity consumption has become a primary concern for countries that have adopted it as a primary source of energy. Electricity demand forecasting is an analytical technique used to predict future levels of electricity usage. It helps utilities and other businesses understand where and when peak demand will occur. 
As the world continues to move towards digitalization, the demand for electricity increases constantly. This makes it essential for companies that operate in this space to be able to analyze their own electricity usage and forecast its demand accordingly, for risk managing purposes.

**Time series analysis** can be used to better understand characteristics of electricity demand and forecast usage patterns. In this project, time series analysis is used to uncover hidden relationships in electricity production data, predict future demand, and identify trends. Pandas and machine learning in Python have been used to perform the time series analysis.

## Solution

- Programming language: Python
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: 
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Statsmodels.Seasonal Decompose
  - Numpy
  - scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The raw data for this project contains a time series data of a single variable, the electricity amount. The data is aggregated on a monthly basis from January 1st, 1985 to January 1st 2018.

A quick sketch of the electricity generation throughout the years looks like below:
